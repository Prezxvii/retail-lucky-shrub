              Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love
                    for
                    plants. Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his
                    team
                    of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company and oversees the  nursery.
